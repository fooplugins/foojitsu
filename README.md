##FooJitsu

This library was created as we started to drop support for IE8 and write our plugins using plain JavaScript. It is modeled after jQuery's public API, 
and although it does not support the massive amount of utility methods that jQuery does, it is only 15kb minified at the moment while jQuery 2.0.0 
(no IE8 jQuery) is up at 84kb.

This is just a temporary readme as it's still in development.
